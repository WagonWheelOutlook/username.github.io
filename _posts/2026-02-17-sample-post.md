# Welcome to My Blog 🎉

This is a **sample blog post** created to test how my GitHub Pages site looks with a longer article.  
I’ll include headings, lists, quotes, and even code snippets to see how everything renders.

---

## Section 1: Introduction
Blogging with GitHub Pages and Jekyll is simple once you understand the basics.  
You don’t need to write complex code — just Markdown files like this one.

---

## Section 2: Lists
Here’s an unordered list:
- Item one
- Item two
- Item three

And an ordered list:
1. First step
2. Second step
3. Third step

---

## Section 3: Quotes
> “The journey of a thousand miles begins with a single step.” – Lao Tzu

---

## Section 4: Code Blocks
You can also show code snippets:

```bash
# Trigger a rebuild with an empty commit
git commit --allow-empty -m "Rebuild site"
git push


---

### ⚡ Key Rules for Code Blocks in Markdown
- Always start with three backticks: ```` ``` ````  
- Optionally add a language (e.g., `bash`, `python`, `html`) for syntax highlighting.  
- Always close with three backticks on a new line.  
- Don’t indent the backticks — they must be flush left.  

---

👉 If you want to test longer snippets (like Python or HTML), just follow the same pattern. Do you want me to give you a **multi‑language sample post** (with Bash, Python, and HTML blocks) so you can check how your theme styles different code types?
